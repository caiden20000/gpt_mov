Make videos with GPT, ElevenLabs, and moviepy

Currently working on a frontend shortform AI-generated video sequence editor using SQLite and Flask...

Development got a lot slower when I disabled copilot, but I felt like I was making myself braindead with it turned on? :/

Roadmap:
- ~~Make it work from code~~
- Make a frontend editor UI
    - ~~Design the API~~
    - Implement the API
        - ~~Design the database schema~~
        - ~~Design the database interface~~
        - Code the database interface           <--- <b>I am HERE</b>
        - Code the API interface
- Port the UI to web accessability
- Implement security
- (Optional) Charging rates for access to content generated using _my_ API keys
